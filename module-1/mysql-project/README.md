# Guided Project: End-to-End MySQL Database Creation and Analysis

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine everything you have learned about relational databases and SQL so you can see how it all works together. For this project, you will be creating a MySQL database from scratch, populating it with data, and constructing an analytical workflow to explore a data set using various types of joins and queries.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* Data must be normalized into at least 5 tables.
* Produce an entity relationship diagram that visually displays the tables in your database, the fields in your tables, and the existence and types of relationships between your tables.
* Use at least two different types of joins.
* Use at least three different types of queries (SELECT plus two types of action queries).
* Use subqueries and/or temp tables in your workflow.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A .PNG and single-page PDF file** containing the entity relationship diagram for your database.
* **A project.sql file** containing all SQL code and commands used in the construction of your database and analytical workflow.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing an explanation of the process followed in the construction of your database and analytical workflow, results obtained, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Use a data set that is already normalized** - a great place to start looking would be [here](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/search?tableCount%5B%5D=0-10&tableCount%5B%5D=10-30&dataType%5B%5D=Numeric&databaseSize%5B%5D=KB&databaseSize%5B%5D=MB).
* **Break the project down into different steps** - creating the database, importing the data set and schema, generating the entity relationship diagram, examining the schema, coming up with a plan for your analysis, following through with that plan, and making adjustments where necessary.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of entities and relationships, all the SQL commands you've learned, different types of joins, different types of queries, etc.
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.

## Potential Project Ideas

### Basketball Database Analysis

You are a data analyst for a professional basketball league. The league has data about teams, players, coaches, playoff game results, etc. but they need the data organized, analyzed, and summarized. Any interesting insights found should be reported to the league's senior executives.

### Credit Database Analysis

You are a data analyst working for a credit card company. The company has data about cardholders, statements, charges, payment statuses, etc. and they need help putting together reporting around payment statuses, age of payments past due, and likely defaults.

### Hardware Retail Database Analysis

You work as a data analyst for a small hardware retailer. The company has data about products, customers, sales, and employees. They have less than 25 employees, so they would like to figure out where they should focus their sales and marketing efforts given their limited resources.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectactions, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 6 minutes
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 9 minutes

### Attire

* DRESS TO IMPRESS: [Smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) would be great

### Outputs

* A presentation in [slides.com](https://slides.com/)
* A demo deployed on GitHub Pages
* The presentation and demo will be executed on a class computer (instead of your own)
* Get ready to explain some of your code in GitHub

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* A hobby you have.
  * __Note: we are getting you ready for final presentation!__
* Elevator pitch:
  * Data set you chose.
  * Why did you chose that data set?
  * The most important thing you learned.
* One technical challenge you faced:
  * Explain the challenge.
  * Explain how and what you did to overcome it.
  * Show and explain code snippets in your presentation slides.
* Git:
  * Display an screenshot of your GitHub graphs to show your commit frequency and how much work you did.
* Database & SQL Walkthrough:
  * Walk the audience through your entity relationship diagram, the entities that exist in your database, the attributes for each entity, and the relationships between entities.
  * Walk the audience through you analytical workflow including what initial questions you posed, what your findings were, what avenues you decided to pursue and why, what your conclusions are, and what lessons you learned.
* One important mistake you made:
  * Did you made a mistake planning your time? Maybe scoping your analysis? Coding?
