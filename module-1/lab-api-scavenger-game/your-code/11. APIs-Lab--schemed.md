# Lab | API Scavenger Game





## **Create an access token** in your **[Github account](https://github.com/settings/tokens).**

1. `Generate new token` in the page.
2. Enter token description.
3. Select the scopes for which you allow the token to access. Check at least all the `repo` checkboxes as shown in the screenshot below.
4. Click `Generate token`. Github will create a personal access token for you.

[![Github create personal token](https://github.com/ironhack-datalabs/madrid-oct-2018/raw/master/images/github-create-token.png)](https://github.com/ironhack-datalabs/madrid-oct-2018/blob/master/images/github-create-token.png)

A **personal access token** is a **secret password to allow you or your app to make remote requests to the Github API**. It is the same **[oAuth](https://oauth.net/)  technology** as the Twitter developer access token discussed in the  lesson but in Github you don't need to wait for the approval and your token will be available immediately.

save the token on your computer - uses  **[oAuth](https://oauth.net/)  technology**ill 

If for any reason you lost your  token, simply come back to Github and re-authorize yourself a new token.

 **Do  not share your Github personal access token with anyone else! Hackers  can use your token to do bad things that make damage and result in  suspension of your account.**

After generating the token, you can test it with `curl` in the Terminal. Assuming your Git username is `johndoe` and token is `d10ev1shpm10x5qox9ckw1k9b792p9rq0ogplpn5cyo55`, you can make the curl command in the following way:

```
$ curl -u johndoe:d10ev1shpm10x5qox9ckw1k9b792p9rq0ogplpn5cyo55 https://api.github.com/user
```

If your token is valid, you will see a JSON response that looks like:

```
{
  "login": "johndoe",
  "id": 1234567,
  "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3OTg=",
  "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1659798?v=4",
  "gravatar_id": "",
  "url": "https://api.github.com/users/johndoe",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/johndoe",
  "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johndoe/followers",
  ...
}
```

Because it is inconvenient to read long API responses in Terminal,  you can **export the response into a physical file** with the following  command:

```
$ curl -u johndoe:d10ev1shpm10x5qox9ckw1k9b792p9rq0ogplpn5cyo55 https://api.github.com/user > outpout.json
```

Then you can open `output.json` with your favorite text editor to have a deep look.t

response = requests.get(“https://api.github.com/repos/ironhack-datalabs/madrid-oct-2018/forks“)



Access token is one of the ways to **authenticate requests to Github API**.  Alternatively, you **can also use your Github username and password.  Howeve**r, you'll **need to manually enter your password e**very time when you  make API requests. In contrast, access token allows you to make  requests without entering password manually. For more informatioun about  Github API authentications, refer to [this](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/) and [this](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/) documentation.

## Goals￼

 collect a list of items following  clues: you will be  seeking secrets hidden inside the massive data from the API. 

### Challenge 1: Fork Languages

Find out among all the forks created from the `ironhack-datalabs/madrid-oct-2018` repo, how many types of languages are used. 

Steps:

1. Obtain all the forks of the `ironhack-datalabs/madrid-oct-2018` through Github API.

2. Loop the JSON response for the `language` attribute of each fork. Use an array to store the `language` attributes of each fork. The values in the array should be unique.

3. Print the language array. It should be something like:

   `["Python", "Jupyter Notebook", "HTML"]`

Again, the documentation of Github API is [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

### Challenge 2: Count Commits

Count how many commits were made between October 20, 2018 and October 25, 2018.

1. Obtain all the commits made between October 20, 2018 and October 25,  2018 via API, which is a JSON array that contains multiple commit  objects.
2. Count how many commit objects are there in the array.

### 

### Challenge 3: Hidden Cold Joke

Using Python, call Github API to find out the cold joke contained in the 24 secret files in this repo whose filenames contain `.scavengerhunt`. The secret files are named from `.0001.scavengerhunt` to `.0024.scavengerhunt`. They are scattered randomly throughout this repo. You need to **search for these files by calling the Github API**, not searching on your computer.

Notes:

- Github API documentation can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

- Data analysts often use `curl` to test the parameters of  API requests in Terminal because it's quick. You will need to inspect  the JSON responses from the API and determine if that is the information  you look for. If not, research the documentations and refine the  parameters until you obtain the desired information.

- The repo you'll search under is `ironhack-datalabs/madrid-oct-2018`.

- After figuring out the correct parameters, you need to inspect the  JSON data structure and decide how to parse the data objects. Then you  can write the Python scripts to do actual parsing.

- When you test your requests to Github API, sometimes you may be blocked by Github with an error message that reads:

  `You have triggered an abuse detection mechanism and have been  temporarily blocked from content creation. Please retry your request  again later.`

  Don't worry. Check the parameters in your request and wait for a minute or two before you make additional requests.

After you find out the secrete files:

1. Order them ascendingly based on the numeric value in the filenames.
2. Read the content of each secret files into an array of strings.
3. Concatenate the strings in the array separating each two with a whitespace.
4. Print out the joke.

## Additional Challenge for the Nerds

So far we have practiced a lot with the `GET` method but not `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. If you wonder what are the differences, refer to the following:

<https://spring.io/understanding/REST>

Simply put, the `GET` method only allows you to obtain  data from API. But the other methods allow you to modify the data stored  in the database behind the API. The API must be programmed to support  each of these methods though.

The additional challenge for the nerds is for you to use the `PUT` method to create a file in your own repo. You need to grant the correct permissions to your access token in order to make `PUT` requests to your repo.

### 

### Note:

You don't have to use Python in this complex challenge. Simply find out how to do that with `curl` as proof of concept. That's adequate for the purpose of practicing `PUT` for API.

### 

### Steps:

1. Create a new repo (don't use your forked repo for the lab because you  don't want to ruin your lab codes). Assuming your repo is called `johndoe/test-repo`.

2. Call the following API endpoint to create a new file called `test.txt`:

   `https://api.github.com/repos/johndoe/test-repo/contents/test.txt`

   Notes:

   - You'll need to supply a JSON object as the parameter of the `PUT` method that contains at least `message` and `content`.
   - The `content` string must be encoded with [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64). Here is a website for you to [encode a regular string to Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/).

   For detailed documentation, see: <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-a-file>

3. If successful, you should see the following example response from the API:

```
{
  "content": {
    "name": "test.txt",
    "path": "test.txt",
    "sha": "0d5a690c8fad5e605a6e8766295d9d459d65de42",
