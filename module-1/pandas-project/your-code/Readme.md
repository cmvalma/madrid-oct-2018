## Meta notes

Most interesting comments are **in the Jupyter notebook**, alongside the code. There you can follow the steps taken to accomplish the requirements. 

Here are mostly notes that could interrupt the work-flow or the reading-flow if they were in the .ipynb; specially questions, pending topics or to-do later tasks. 
 

## Requirements:

Using messy data:

    * Import the data using Pandas.
    * Examine the data for potential issues.
    * Use at least 8 of the cleaning and manipulation methods you have learned on the data.
    * Produce a Jupyter Notebook that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
    * Export a clean CSV version of your data using Pandas.
