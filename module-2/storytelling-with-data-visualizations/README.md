# Guided Project: Storytelling with Data Visualization

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to practice creating beautiful and concise visualizations that tell us something interesting and insightful about your choice of dataset.

<b>You will be working individually for this project</b>, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. 

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:
 - Select a dataset from a public source.
 - Create a Jupyter notebook to analyze the data
 - Create at least 3 different data visualizations that are clear and concise. Graphs should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis when appropriate as well as a title for the graph.
 - Explain what insight or information is inferred from these visualizations. The explanation should be in the notebook in markdown cells.
## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your GitHub repo for this chapter.

- <b>A Jupyter notebook</b> containing your analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis.
- <b>A data folder</b> containing your data set.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Find a data set to process** - a great place to start looking would be [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). A great new source is the [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch).
* **Perform Preliminary Analysis** - use functions like `describe` to help guide you to the correct insight and data visualization. 
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of the different types of visualizations and when to use them should come in handy with this assignment.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectations, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 6 minutes
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 9 minutes

### Attire

* DRESS TO IMPRESS: [Smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) would be great

### Outputs

* Present your findings using the Jupyter notebook.
* The presentation and demo will be executed on a class computer (instead of your own).
* Be prepared to explain your entire notebook and thought process.

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* Your favorite thing about this course so far
  * __Note: we are getting you ready for final presentation!__
* Introduction
  * Data set you chose.
  * Why did you choose that data set?
  * The most important thing you learned.
* The code
    * Be prepared to explain your code as well as markdown comments 
* The visualizations
    * Explain your choice of visualizations and how you customized them to make them more clear for the reader
* Your insight
    * Explain what insight you derived from the visualizations and what this tells us about the data
