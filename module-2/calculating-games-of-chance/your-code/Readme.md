# Games of Chance : The Monty Hall Game and a proof of the change strategy

Here you can play the Monty Hall game with the three most distinct strategies: random ,  conservative (keep your selection) and the counterintuitive strategy of change that was the focus of a long discussion  among statisticians. 

The Jupyter Notebook even introduces the Monty Hall problem, so it is very self-descriptive. Play it first, then you can see the proof in part II. 

Test like the t student are needed and will be done shortly.
