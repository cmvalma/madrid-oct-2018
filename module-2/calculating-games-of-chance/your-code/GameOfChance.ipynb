    "<blockquote> \"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? \"</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is based on how part of \"Let's make a deal\", a famous US TV game show, worked since 1963 to 1976. In 1973 Steve Selvin wrote a letter to the \"American Statistician\" (made famour later by Vos Savant's) in which he asserted that the contestant should switch to the other door (vos Savant 1990a). Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a 1/3 chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many readers of vos Savant's column refused to believe switching is beneficial despite her explanation. After the problem appeared in Parade, approximately 10,000 readers, including nearly 1,000 with PhDs, wrote to the magazine, most of them claiming vos Savant was wrong (Tierney 1991). Even when given explanations, simulations, and formal mathematical proofs, many people still do not accept that switching is the best strategy (vos Savant 1991a). Even Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, refused it for a long time. \n",
